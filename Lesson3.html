									<i><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">Lesson 3</p></i>


									<h3>Overview.</h3>

									<p>
										The stark difference I saw when I joined my new group compared to when it was just my partner and myself was very surprising as I didn’t realise how great power in numbers was. With everyone in the group being able to conduct even just 2 interviews per week resulted in 12 interviews in total allowing us to gather more evidence to formulate more in-depth conclusions. The calibre of students in the group also improved my quality of work as I was required to match the higher standard and meet the quota of at least two interviews per week. The adoption of a divide and conquer approach after realising that we wanted to target 8 industries meant that we were able to cater to our strengths depending on our connections and understand each industry in depth (examples in Appendix C at the end of the page).
									</p>

									<br>
									<h3>Evaluation.</h3>
									<p>
										From the beginning having gone to multiple consultations, I knew that it was recommended to go into groups, but it was only after being in the bigger group that I understood the major advantages. The use of collaborative tools and allocation of tasks streamlined the reach out process as only one person in the team had to produce a reach out template which everyone used. I also noticed that members usually got guilt-tripped into completing their work at a higher standard if they saw other members generating results which occurred regularly as our group was very high achieving. Each member brought their own strengths and connections which allowed for greater progress which wouldn’t have happened if I stayed as a pair. This allowed me to realise that you are usually as good as the people you surround yourself with which solidified my wish to work at a large corporation such as Amazon or Atlassian filled with highly intelligent people with various expertise. If I did not take that initial action of stepping outside of my comfort zone to reach out to other groups, I believe that the situation would be much worse in terms of my progress and learnings. Being able to optimise the process to cater to a larger group by adopting the divide and conquer approach was also something that I did not think of doing and allowed me to bring it to my other group projects. Understanding ways of streamlining processes and gaining that skill of finding pain points to optimise is something that I wish to continually improve upon so that I can spend my time on activities that have larger impacts.

									<h3>Conclusion.</h3>

									<p>
										In the future, I will make sure that I continue to work at a high standard and put in efforts to maintain the optimisation skills that I gained working in the new group. I will strive to join companies where I truly believe I will be able to develop my technical and interpersonal skillsets to reach my full potential and hopefully continue on my entrepreneurial journey. This learning made me realise that you truly are a product of your own environment.

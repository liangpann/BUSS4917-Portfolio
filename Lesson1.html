									<h2 style="text-align: center;">Leadership Development is uncomfortable</h2>
									<i><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">Lesson 1</p></i>


									<h3>Overview.</h3>

									<p>
										For the duration of the course, I acted upon the Leadership in Action Plan to develop my Servant Leadership (Leadership in Action Plan shown in Appendix A at the bottom of the page). It was created by my partner tailored to my weaknesses which helped me target three objectives:
										<ol style="padding-left: 50px;">
											<li>Speak up more to what I morally stand for when interacting with others.</li>
											<li>Focus on ensuring that reputational impact doesn’t interfere with my ethical decision-making process.</li>
											<li>Enrol in a leadership course in order to further understand my leadership style.</li>
										</ol>
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Evaluation.</h3>
									<p>
										In terms of the first goal, as someone whose personality weakness is that I tend to be conflict-averse, it was difficult to break out of this habit and essentially start a “fight” with someone knowing that it would make of us both very uncomfortable. After the third week having finished the first hurdle of the Leadership in Action Plan Assignment, I realised that my partner was not being as communicative as he was in the first few weeks and that I was the only one reaching out to firms. Normally I would not speak out about this, but with no success in contacting any firms by myself, I realised that a lot more ground needed to be covered and so reached out to students in the course hoping to join their group. After finding another group, I spoke to my partner about this as I was ethically torn between leaving my partner behind and the low mark I was going to receive if I didn’t take action quickly. I realised that it was not enough just to let my partner know that I was joining another group, but aspects of negotiation and teamwork was also required to satisfy each party’s concerns. In order to solve this, I negotiated with the new team and eventually got my partner to join as well. Upon reflection, understanding the downsides of having too many members as this would make decision making and discussions a lot more complicated and knowing the upsides that more members would allow us to cover more ground in finding a market for our IP allowed me to negotiate more effectively. Ever since then we have been able to work cooperatively and interviewed 35 key players in various industries for the IP.

									<p>
										The other two goals were achieved outside of this course at work by vocalising my concerns about the amount of story points I was taking on each sprint and by enrolling in the <i>‘Psychology in the Workplace’</i> course to learn more about my leadership style. I have been able to allocate my time more efficiently with my work stress declining from lower amounts of story points and have also been able to learn lifelong skills in conflict management and persuasion.

									<h3>Conclusion.</h3>

									<p>
										From these interactions, I discovered that I’m a people pleaser and severely dislike the feeling of letting people down. Upon reflection, I could have played a better role in letting my partner know earlier about my decision to change groups and suggesting alternative fallbacks for him to act upon such as passing him all the work I had already started. In the future, in order to lessen the discomfort of all parties involved, I’ll continue to think more deeply about the perspectives of each party and make more informed judgement calls.

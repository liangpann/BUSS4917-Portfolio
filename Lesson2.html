									<h2 style="text-align: center;">Accept failure as part of the journey</h2>
									<i><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">Lesson 2</p></i>


									<h3>Overview.</h3>

									<p>
										As with most journeys, failing is an opportunity to learn from your mistakes and adapt moving forward. In the two weeks after the Leadership in Action Plan assignment, I reached out to 5 companies and did not hear back from any of them. This made me very anxious as I thought it was not only going to reflect poorly in my individual report 1 mark but subsequently impact my pitch at the end of the semester. The fact that my partner did not reach out to any firms and my work and extracurricular commitments also intensifying did not help. Evidence of my reach out is described in my Individual Report 1 (Appendix B at the bottom of the page).
									</p>

									<br>

									<h3>Evaluation.</h3>
									<p>
										The main learning from this event was that as mentioned earlier, after contacting firms by myself and not getting any leads, I realised that joining a team was imperative in covering more ground to find a market for the IP. I also learnt that international companies were more difficult to contact and that I should have done some pre-emptive reach outs to figure out which industries were the easiest to gain information. Reaching out earlier would have helped give companies a chance to find the right person to contact me as I was getting replies weeks later. The failure of not being able to contact any firms in week 4 motivated me to not only innovate and change IPs but join a bigger group and reach out to personal contacts in hopes of gaining stronger leads (delved into later). The fact that I worked 3 days per week also meant that I had limited hours to reach out to firms during office hours. Being in a group gave me an opportunity to ask team members to take my calls if necessary.
										<br>
										<br>
										I discovered that being in those uncomfortable and high stress situations pushed me to innovate and find ways to navigate out of the situation, playing to my strength of being a strong problem solver. This aligns with my job prospect of working as a Software Engineer and becoming more entrepreneurial which usually entails working in stressful situations with deadlines in the form of sprints. I have been able to see this happen at my work to push new features out each week requiring me to not only learn new skills every day but count on my co-workers to assist me if they have more expertise on the matter.

									<h3>Conclusion.</h3>

									<p>
										Improvements that I identified that I could work on are being clearer minded after the initial burst of anxiety and thinking my decisions through more thoroughly before making them so as to not make any rash decisions that could negatively impact my work or personal relationships. As per my last learning, I saw my rash decisions negatively impact my relationship with my partner which opened up my eyes to the sensitivity of navigating through personal relationships.

									<h3>Overview.</h3>

									<p>
										One major mistake that I made at the beginning of the semester was that I did not think to leverage my personal connections to find more relevant contacts and instead reached out to external companies and individuals which lead to no results as mentioned earlier. After switching IPs, I reached out to my family and friends in the medical field as well as doctors I worked with for my computer science industry project course last semester which proved to be very successful as they were able to introduce me to their connections shown below.

									<h3>Evaluation.</h3>
									<p>
										Similar to the last learning, after going to consultations, the advice I received was to pick an IP that I had personal connections in and to leverage those to find stronger leads. Given that my partner saw greater potential in the Recycling Carbon Fibre IP (where we both didn’t have any connections in), we decided to choose that instead of a medical IP (where I had connections in) and luckily switched to the 3D printing IP when joining the new group. One area I could have improved on was to raise my ideas more strongly and have more of an opinionated stance. As someone who refrains from asking others for help, this was a huge step in overcoming this challenge as I reached out to people I wasn’t as close with and doctors who I believed would be too busy to respond. This stemmed from my belief that others would find me annoying, and my questions would distract them from their already busy schedule. After putting myself in their position and believing that I would help my friends if they asked me in that situation and the looming deadline and pressure from the group to perform, I sent out messages and got lots of positive feedback and was able to conduct 3 interviews because of it (shown in my Individual Report 3 in Appendix D at the bottom of the page). The initial fear turned into excitement and relief as I took a leap of faith into the unknown.
									</p>

									<br>
									<h3>Conclusion.</h3>

									<p>
										In the past, I have tried not to ask others for help and instead worked on projects by myself, which is not always bad as a few of my projects have been able reach over 450,000 users from around the world. However, after seeing the results that I was able to achieve from reaching out to others for help especially after initially trying myself, I’ll make sure that I reach out to others if I need assistance in doing something that I can’t do myself and also make sure that I help out others if they ask for help.

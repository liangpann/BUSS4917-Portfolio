									<h3>Overview.</h3>

									<p>
										Given the nature of the course, there were a number of learnings that I had to figure out on my own to understand what was required and to make sure that I was on the right track to validating a market for the IP. The opportunity to attend consults was very helpful as I was able to ask questions to gain a clearer understanding of the task at hand and get ideas on areas to focus on. It also gave me a chance to listen to what other groups were doing and ultimately allowed me to find my new group. One question that I asked during the consult that was able to help the rest of the cohort was the clarification of which week we were currently at. It might not seem like a big deal, but I was very surprised that I was the first person to bring it up with Alex and thought that someone else would have already asked. This showed me that sometimes the most obvious mistakes are often overlooked and that your perspectives are very unique.

									<h3>Evaluation.</h3>
									<p>
										The format of this course led me to draw parallels with the work force where you often get allocated a new feature each week to complete and are required to research methods of implementing it with minimal supervision and guidance. I realised that I excel at being allocated a task with minimal supervision and find ways of getting it done by the deadline as I am proactive in finding solutions to the questions I have. This perfectly aligns with my job prospect of working as a Software Engineer or Product Manager where your work is often complex and requires you to think outside of the box.
										<br>
										<br>
										Given the ambiguous nature of the course, I had my first interview with Axel from Sydney Dental Hospital and realised that I didn’t know enough about the IP to answer his questions. Although the questions he asked were largely technical, I felt very uncomfortable during the interview as I wasn’t sure how to direct the rest of the interview. After this, I made sure to further understand the IP as well as understand what questions I wanted to ask to fully understand if there was a market for the IP. I then sent him an email which targeted more of the current processes in place and what improvements they were looking for in the Dental Space (shown below). This was useful as he answered with relevant information that I was able to report back to the group with. This taught me that persistence and ability to reflect on your experiences allows an individual to foster better results.

									<h3>Conclusion.</h3>

									<p>
										In the future, I will make sure that I am more prepared for interviews or meetings and have questions and back up questions in place. Alternatively, having another member in the team with me with more expertise in the matter would have allowed me to get an understanding of the type of information we were looking for which I would have taken to my later interviews.
